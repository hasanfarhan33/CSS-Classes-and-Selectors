                I am going to type a lot of stuff to test my code. I can 
                type many things. I hope I type well and propoerly. I need to 
                type so much. I can talk about whatever you want. There is an error 
                here. So I should explain what the error is. Well, the error is 
                that there is no error. Error is just the name of the class here. So 
                it is kind of like a fake error.

                I cannot wait for the second part of season 4 of Attack on 
                Titan. I hope I don't get spoiled before the second part is 
                released. AoT fanbase is cool but sometimes they can be pretty
                toxic.

                I think I have now typed enough. I hope I get an internship 
                and graduate on time. If not, then it is not the end of the world. 
                Life is unpredictable. Not everything goes according to the plan. 
                No matter how much you plan.
